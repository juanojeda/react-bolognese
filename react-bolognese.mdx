## What this talk isn't

- An intro to an npm package

```
yarn add bolognese
```

<Notes>It's a html5 editor package, btw</Notes>

---

## What this talk is

- A primer on Atomic Design
- A way to help you unravel the spaghetti
- An analogy stretched too far

<Notes>

- How I approach atomic design
- A way to think
- unravel the spaghetti code _badoom tish_
- a guide for how granular to go with components
- I'm using spaghetti bolognese as an analogy for UI dev

</Notes>

---

## Atomic Design

<Notes>

- show of hands, how many people know what atomic design is?
- buzz word for component development and design

</Notes>

---

## Atomic Design

- A design / development methodology
- A mental model for components

---

### Atomic Design

- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms
- ... (templates/pages) ...

<Notes>

- atoms
- they make up Molecules
- they both make up organisms
- then we can build templates and pages
- they break the atomic analogy, but that's ok

</Notes>

---

## The problem with atoms...

<Notes>

- Problem with Atom terminology
- Forces you to think at the smallest granular level
- Sometimes you go smaller than necessary
- How deep should we go?

</Notes>

<Notes>You can always go deeper</Notes>

### Convenience store dinner

- microwave spaghetti bolognese

<Notes>

- most basic component: the whole thing
- heat, peel and eat

- Pros: quick, low effort

- Cons:
- Not very reusable
- Not very 'tweakable'

</Notes>

---

### Easy store-bought dinner

- store-bought bolognese ragu
- packet fresh spaghetti

<Notes>

- Next level up in complexity
- two components
- heat the pasta in some boiling water
- heat the ragu in a saucepan
- serve

- Pros: quick, low effort, additive tweaks
- Cons: not that reusable, no subtractive tweaks

</Notes>

### Home cooked dinner: Components

- cooked spaghetti
- bolognese ragu

</Split>

<Notes>

- Next level up in complexity
- Still the same two components on the plate
- Since we are making it at home, we can look deeper

</Notes>

<Split>

### Home cooked dinner: Atoms

<div style={{textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '4rem'}}>

- dry spaghetti
- minced beef
- onion
- carrot
- celery
- garlic
- tomato paste
- passata

</div>

</Split>

<Notes>

- atom list looks like ingredients
- you don't just throw these all together
- combine different atoms to make molecules, organisms
- eg. dry spaghetti plus boiling water and time makes your cooked spaghetti
- eg. your onion, carrot celery will make your "soffrito", a molecule

</Notes>

### From-scratch dinner: Components

- cooked spaghetti
- bolognese ragu

</Split>

<Notes>

- Again, same components, but fancier
- If youre going all out you make it from scratch
- Break it down as far as you can

</Notes>

<Split>

### From-scratch dinner: Atoms

<div style={{textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: '4rem'}}>

- fresh eggs
- tipo 00 flour
- beef chuck
- pork shoulder
- veal short rib
- onion
- carrot
- celery
- garlic
- fresh tomatoes
- milk

</div>

</Split>

<Notes>

- Now the ingredients list is longer
- Pasta from scratch
- You'll need a mincer to use these meat atoms
- you'll need a lot of time to use the tomato atom to make tomato paste and passata
- Probably overkill for your weeknight dinner, but could be good for a special occasion

<Notes>

It depends on a few things:

- what you want to reuse
- how much time you have
- what your capabilities are
- system support, how much you might want to tweak in the future, etc.

</Notes>

---

## Code and Recipe time

---

## Summary:

- Use atoms/molecules/organisms
- Components should be as big as you need
- Cut down components for reuse/remix/maintainability
- Folder structure helps
